## 3. Technologies Used

The application was built using the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

The HTML structure consists of a form for adding new tasks, a tasks list container for displaying tasks, and a heading for the list of tasks. The form has an input field for typing task content and a "Dodaj zadanie" (Add Task) button for submitting the form.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the to-do list. It includes functions for adding new tasks, removing tasks, and toggling the "done" status of tasks. Event listeners are used to capture user actions, such as form submission, button clicks, and task removal.

The CSS code is used for styling the web application. It includes styles for the form, tasks list, buttons, and other elements. The CSS uses the Montserrat font from Google Fonts and the Normalize CSS library for cross-browser consistency.
